title:  "Firefox Screenshots"

Just another really cool feature I discovered that I wanted to share.

**Firefox Screenshots** allows for full-page screenshots in a browser, and is _very_ easy to use and accessible _(and doesn't require anything new to be installed if you are already using a furryfox browser!)_

## How to take a screenshot in 2019

1. In Firefox, in the Address Bar, click the **Three Dots** > **Take a Screenshot**

3. Click **Download**.

4. Collect the downloaded image from in your browser downloads.
