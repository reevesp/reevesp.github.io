title:  "Wiping my Macbook"
---

I recently needed to wipe my old macbook before returning it. The macbook was one of the ones affected by [the battery issue (described in an Apple note here)](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall) and its time was due.

I've never actually needed to "clean up" a mac before, so it was worth a google.

My concerns were:

- How can I make sure that none of my files are left on the device?
- How can I make sure that none of my logins could be used?

I've already got all of my mac backed-up.

And after a bit of looking, I'll be honest, Apple doco is pretty good. (When it is good.) Here are the two articles that I used. The instructions are basically `Boot into MacOS Recovery, Click 'delete'`.
