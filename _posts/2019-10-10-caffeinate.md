title:  "Using the caffeinate to prevent Mac from sleeping"
---

Something interesting that I just learned today.

The `caffeinate` command on mac prevents the OS from sleeping. Run it in a terminal and then walk away from your desk.

Perfect for leaving a big set of files (like an IBM DownloadDirector) to download overnight on in an evening!
Or for leaving a big machine backup-restore to complete...

```
man caffeinate
```
