title:  "What do the F-Droid 'Anti-features' disclaimers actually mean?"
---

On my personal Android phone, I have been trying to use the F-Droid app store and reduce my dependency on the Google store.

One thing that I was cautious about was the vagueness of the "_This app has features you may not like._" I was curious about the detail!

A little bit of googling and I found a page on the [F-Droid wiki](https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/AntiFeatures) from which I can click through to get more detailed descriptions of the particular functionality.
